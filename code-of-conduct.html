        <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
        <p>We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, characteristics, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race or religion.</p>
    
        <h2>Our Standards</h2>
        <h3>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
            <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
            <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
            <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
            <li>Public or private harassment</li>
            <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
            <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
        <p>Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.</p>
    
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.</p>
        <p>Consequences for violating the Code of Conduct may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion from the project, depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
